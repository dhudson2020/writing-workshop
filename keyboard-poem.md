the stem which bounces up and down pushed up by
the spring which keeps the stem away from 
the actuator made of copper that connects the stem to
the wires which connect the sharp pins in the form of
a matrix of wires being polled every now and again by
the controller which translates outputs from the matrix into
keycodes which are numbers representing letters get translated to
binary ones and zeroes the pulses of electricity switching on and off across 
the cable which ends in a usb plug getting sent into

letters which get put next to each other on

words which have a meaning all their own but are most effective in
sentences

code
or
phrases
