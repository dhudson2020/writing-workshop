to the editor of every computer magazine, ever:

cherry mx isn't the only switch type.

there's no such thing as a keyboard with "blue" switches. 

you're thinking of cherry MX. 

it's like saying "the 6 phone" and assuming everyone knew you meant the iPhone 6.

there's many, many other brands.

kalih, outemu, gateron, zealPC, alps, matias, logitech, and razer, to name a few.

each with their own unique feel, activation distance, force diagram, and some with their own stem type even.

i'm typing this out on my cartel contra with kalih pro burgundies.

sincerely, me.

To the editor, and everyone reading this:

Your identity is valid. 
Whether you're trans, gay, non-binary, bisexual, asexual, aromantic, or anything else.
Nobody has the power to tell you who to be.
If you don't feel like a guy or a girl, you don't have to be one.
If you like guys, or girls, neither, or both, it's okay. Neither you nor anybody else can change that.

To the editor:

Conversion therapy is a horrible, horrible practice and should be banned nationwide. Let me explain.
If you don't know what conversion therapy is, it's a special type of therapy you can give your child
to change their sexuality. Seems okay if a bit dodgy in concept, right? Well, the devil is in the 
details. Conversion therapy in practice is usually akin to torture. The child in question is 
electrocuted, beaten, whipped, and otherwise caused pain or suffering while being shown images or 
videos relating to their sexuality, in the hopes that their mind will associate being gay with being
shocked or tortured. There are laws to prevent this in 10 states (plus D.C.) but still 70% of the
LGBT population live in places where it's still a legal practice. As of writing this, 13 states 
have legislation in the process of being passed, and Missouri is one of them. Support House bill
2141 however you can, and we'll be one step closer to ending this torture forever.

Sincerely,
