Restart, it fixes everything.
That's all you ever hear.
You've heard it a thousand times before.
And yet, again it's here.

To turn it off and on again, 
Must be a magic trick.
Users must just not be getting it.
They must be getting sick.

Every time their PC's broken
It must be IT's fault.
And every single thing they say
Take it with a grain of salt.

You spilled water on your laptop,
Yet IT gets the blame.
Man, tech support just cannot win,
In your stupid office game.

"Wow, IT is so useless,
My computer doesnt work!"
But IT does so much for them, 
How could they be such a jerk?

Every day, behind the scenes:
A unique problem unfolds.
The server's down, a network storm.
A new tale each time it's told.

And IT is a thankless job,
Well, for the most part.
All we get is a "k, thanks, bye"
For telling you how to click start.

And the users are sometimes idiots
But I mean hey, aren't we all?
We forget to plug things in
To the power strip, or wall.

But they can't all be nerds like us
Or the world would likely fall
Because if everyone works in IT,
Who'd be there to play football?

And we're all smart in some regard
And useless in another.
Like I'll fix your PC any day
But I can't diagnose your mother.

And I'll admit, I'm guilty too.
Of being rude for no reason.
Especially to the A/C technician
In the midst of the summer season.

So if you're a doctor or a lawyer,
Or a surgeon of the heart:
Be nice to your IT people,
And give your computer a restart.
