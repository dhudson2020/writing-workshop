Restart, restart, restart.
That's all you ever hear.
You've heard it a thousand times before.
And yet, again it's here.

To turn it off and on again, 
Must be a magic trick.
Users must just not be getting it.
They must be getting sick.

"Man, IT is so useless,
My computer doesnt work!"
But IT does so much for them, 
How could they be such a jerk?

Every day, behind the scenes:
A unique problem unfolds.
The server's down, a network storm.
A new tale each time it's told.

And the users are sometimes idiots
I mean hey, aren't we all?
We forget to plug things in
To the power strip, or wall.

But we can't all be nerds like us
Or the world would likely fall
Because if everyone works in IT,
Who'd be there to play football?

And we're all smart in some regard
And useless in another.
Like I'll fix your PC any day
But I can't diagnose your mother.

So if you're a doctor or a lawyer,
Or a surgeon of the heart:
Be nice to your IT people,
And give your computer a restart.
