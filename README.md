# A writing workshop.

Made in github, because I like github.

## Writing pieces so far:

### Poems (poyems)

1. A poem about a keyboard which delves into the issues of free speech. It's incomplete, but you can view it [here.](keyboard-poem.txt) If you want to see the poem as it was before my first peer conference, you can do that [here.](github.com/thecakeisalie25/writing-workshop/blob/493ff302ce2e597ee898698ca31b53a3cb9399c8/keyboard-poem.txt)
