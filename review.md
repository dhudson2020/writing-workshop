# Cartel's Contra: A Review.

It's a very small keyboard, a very small keyboard indeed. One of the smallest I've ever seen. It has what's called an "ortholinear" layoutrev: a 4x12 grid of keys, laid out in rows and columns, not staggered and wonky like a normal keyboard. From the side it just looks like a bunch of useless tech, a plate on the bottom, separating the controller from the surface below it. Attached to that, is the middle plate, held off of the bottom one by golden stand-offs. Some pins protrude from the bottom plate, pins that hold the middle plate to the top plate, where the keys reside. All this comes together to form one of the smaller layouts: an ortholinear 40%. Inspired by the ever-popular (relatively) Planck layout, the Cartel Contra is the world's cheapest ortholinear keyboard. Coming in at just $30-40, which includes all 3 plates, the controller, and some other bits of kit that you need to assemble it, it's one of the cheapest DIY keyboards in general, if not the cheapest. Once assembled using the instructions in the box, it's just plug-and-play, no need for specific software. Assemble it with linear switches, like the Kalih Pro Linears I used, and it's quiet too. 

3 main layers, and 1 extra layer (for adjustments and the like) dictate what buttons do what, and when they do it. That way, you can have as few keys as you want, and still have all the functionality of a regular keyboard. You might look at this keyboard at first and say "How do you even type the number one?" but there's a simple answer: `Raise`+`Q`. And so it goes with numbers, so it goes with everything else. All essential keys are on separate layers, accessed by the `Raise` and `Lower` keys. Think of them as my own version of `Ctrl`, or `Shift`. When pushed, they change the "layer" and change the functionality of some of the keys. Everything a normal keyboard has, this keyboard has. In fact, there's probably more "keys" than a regular keyboard has packed into this tiny space. For instance, ever wanted a key that types your email address, so you don't have to? Done. Ever want a key that rickrolls people? Not sure why, but done. There's only one key missing, though: `Shift`. To type a capital letter, just hold the letter for a bit longer. Done. AutoShift takes a bit of getting used to, but once you tweak the timings for how you type, it's a lot faster. Or maybe not, but it's certainly a lot cooler either way. Layers and AutoShift combine to make this keyboard complicated, and require you to memorize a lot before you can get really efficient with it. Who would have guessed that `Raise`+`P` would make the "+" symbol? I would have, but not many other people. I did program it that way, though, so I guess I get a special pass. But is relearning a keyboard really worth it?

Typing on this keyboard is certainly a challenge, and it'll take some time to get used to. But is it worth it? Having a keyboard of this size definitely reduces finger travel (the distance your fingers have to move to get to the desired key) but that can be said of any small keyboard, or even most laptops. And the fact that the keys are arranged in a grid layout certainly doesn't help anything. Nathaniel Hirschler of RhinoFeed.com writes: "I'll be honest. Typing on this keyboard is incredibly challenging for me. I've learned to type on staggered key layouts my entire life, and the ortholinear layout isn't helping my words per minute. I might be able to relearn how to type if I spent a lot of time, but I won't be able to properly type for quite awhile". To use this keyboard effectively you have to memorize each layer, and sort of work around the keyboard as opposed to through it. Suffice to say, it's a hassle to use, and any serious typists may want to avoid it. That being said it does have it's uses. It's nice to have your own keyboard, especially when using them on computers that aren't trustworthy. And it's a cheap, fun project to build. And it's small size means you can take it anywhere, or even use it as a numberpad alongside your regular keyboard and have numerous buttons to spare. And some people can type on them, it really depends on how you type. If you're a touch typist (someone who puts their fingers on the home row and uses all fingers to type) for instance, it'll be a lot easier, but still take some time to get used to.

Personally, I really like this keyboard. While I have a hard time typing on it now, that'll change with practice. It's completely customizable, and the ability to make your own layout really helps give this keyboard some use. Even if you can't get some use out of it as a normal keyboard, it can be useful as a macropad (a special keyboard meant for specific shortcuts that are used a lot) or an enhanced numberpad. The most use I currently get out of it is just as that, a numberpad. Though, that might change if I switch up my layout. That's the main focus I had when building it, just to be customizable, so if I don't like it, I can change it. That's why my final score for this keyboard is a **7/10**. It's customizable beyond words, you can do absolutely anything with this keyboard, but the physical layout makes it hard to want to actually type on the thing. I'll likely keep it around as a macropad after I finish whatever build comes after this, and it'll be a lesson not to go for absurd layouts for your daily driver keyboard. I'll definitely keep trying to learn the layout though, because it seems like an awesome board if you can get used to it. Plus, it's a nice conversation starter.
