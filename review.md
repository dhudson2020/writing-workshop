A very small keyboard, a very small keyboard indeed. One of the smallest I've ever seen. Just a 4x12 grid of keys, laid out in rows and columns, not staggered and wonky like a normal keyboard. From the side it just looks like a bunch of useless tech, a plate on the bottom, separating the controller from the surface below it. Attached to that, is the middle plate, held off of the bottom one by golden stand-offs. Some pins protrude from the bottom plate, pins that hold the middle plate to the top plate, where the keys reside. All this comes together to form one of the smaller layouts: an ortholinear 40%. Inspired by the ever-popular (relatively) Planck layout, the Cartel Contra is the world's cheapest ortholinear keyboard. Coming in at just $30-40, which includes all 3 plates, the controller, and some other bits of kit that you need to assemble it, it's one of the cheapest DIY keyboards in general, if not the cheapest. Once assembled using the instructions in the box, it's just plug-and-play, no need for specific software. Assemble it with linear switches, like the Kalih Pro Linears I used, and it's quiet too.
