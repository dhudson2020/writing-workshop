A couple warnings: this memoir contains discussion about sexuality, strong language, and mentions of suicide. If this disturbs you, leave, and come back when you're above the age of 10. 

You've been warned.

I was around 12 or so, a relatively young age. There's no really specific event that I tie to me realizing things were off, just the realization that they were. It was at this point in my life that I realized that normal people don't have feelings for the same gender. Normal people only like the opposite sex and aggressively defend that fact. The most I'd do was joke off the thought of dating a guy, and usually I'd just keep quiet and sweat profusely. I, of course, did the natural thing anybody would do, given this situation, and shoved these feelings as far as I can into the deepest, darkest corners of my mind, where only my unholy love for spray can cheese resided. And after that? For a while,nothing changed. I kinda just forgot, and went about my 12 year old life like any normal kid would. 

Fast forward to me being 13, and I had become more in tune with it. I still wasn't flaunting to the world that I was bi, but in my mind I had kind of learned to deal with it. I kinda realized that it was just a part of me, nothing I could change, like the color of my skin, or the way I talked. There wasn't really much I could do to change any of them. For the most part I was only romantically interested in girls (or so I showed) to avoid outing myself. I was still closeted, both to my parents and to the world. But that all changed towards the end of the school year. I honestly have one of the most boring coming out stories. (at least to my mom, my dad's is... more interesting.) It was a simple exchange: 

"Mom, I have something important to tell you." I said  
"Oh, what is it, sweetie?" she said, in the patronizing tone she always wore.  
"I think i'm bisexual." I said, and released a heavy sigh.  
"Oh, alright. That means you like boys and girls, right?"  
"Yeah" I replied, relieved she wasn't mad. And that was that.  

And that gave me the confidence to wear my bisexuality more proudly, and thus I did. I came out to a lot of friends, my discord being among the first to know. (Discord is a texting app, with a version for PC and for phones. A discord is basically just a group chat.) I first came out to my smaller discord, it only has maybe 3 friends in it, 2 of which are regularly on it ever. It was a pretty safe bet that they would accept me, seeing as one of the 2 regularly active people on the server was gay, so they were supportive, and not much changed. With my second discord, I actually kinda inspired a few other people to come out when I did, so that was great. They were supportive, both of me and the other 4-ish LGBT people on the discord. After that, I came out to a few friends at school, in person. Like everyone else, they were supportive of me. Eventually the news spread that I was bi, but nothing really changed. It seemed like people were really supportive, and I felt safe. 

Year 14 was largely uneventful, except for one little thing that plays a major part: The shirt. The shirt is a black shirt, with white block letters on it that say "Love is Love.". I got the shirt while shopping for clothes with my grandma, Right as we were about to check out, I mustered up the courage to ask her for the shirt. She said yes, I don't know why. Maybe she didn't know? Maybe she understood, or was accepting of it? Nobody knows but her. Either way, I got the shirt. I brought the shirt home, was asked by my mom about it but not really interrogated. It fell into the normal clothes cycle, with the rest of my shirts, and I wore it every now and again. 

Then year 15 happened. The current year, as of writing this. Across the course of the year, some things happened. In no particular order, the whole vaping thing at my school, a lot of my friends started doing drugs, and the whole "Nobody loves you." school-wide email. Every time I told my mom about something that happened at school, she got all defensive and angry, as if I'd done it. So I just stopped telling her stuff. I also stopped telling her about any of the things happening in my life. Things like my depression, and other stuff along those lines. Stuff I'd need a therapist for. So eventually, she was totally in the dark about my life. The same thing with my dad, he knew absolutely nothing about my life. In retrospect, this likely only compounded the issues in the long term, but it fixed a lot of the ones in the short term, so I kept it up. I kept hiding in my room, working away, doing my thing. This was likely a VERY bad idea on my part, seeing as my parents had really no information on my life to go off of. I'd kept interaction to a minimum with them. All they knew about me was that I got home from school (with barely passing grades), went into my room, and was on my computer until about midnight. That was really it.

<!-- Maybe remove the end of the above paragraph? Not sure how much it adds to the story and it's kinda bad. -->

Soon, I started to notice something. The shirt had gone missing. I'm not very good at keeping track of stuff, but this seemed like too much of a coincidence to be just a clumsy loss of a shirt. Something was off about this whole situation and I knew it from the very start. I questioned my mom about it:

"Hey have you seen my love is love shirt?" I asked.  
"Nope, haven't seen it." She replied.  
"Alright, well keep your eye out for it, and let me know if you see it." I doubtfully said. I added a "Maybe dad took it, you know how he is about the whole LGBT thing."   
"Haha, maybe he did." She replied, seemingly joking about it.  

For me this shirt was more than a shirt, which is why I was really sad when I lost it. It's disappearance would not go unsolved for long, however, seeing as about a week later my mom came into my room and threw the shirt to me.

"Hey, look what I found!" She said.  
"Oh, nice!" I delighted.  
"But you gotta keep quiet about where I found it. You were right, it was dad that took it." She said, her tone becoming more grave.  
"Are you kidding me!?" I asked, a sharp anger rising in my voice. "That's MY shirt, why did he take it? We're gonna have to have a discussion about personal property. Soon."  

And soon the discussion was, seeing as that afternoon my dad approached me about the shirt that was now rightfully back in my possession. We argued back and forth a bit about personal property and what not, but it always came back to the shirt. "Are you gay?" I denied, over and over again. That part was true, technically, because as I've told my parents millions upon millions of times, being bi is not the same as being gay. But the part about the shirt being "in support of my friends, who a lot of are lgbt" is completely untrue. He says that he'd buy me any shirt in the world, any at all, just not that one. I keep pushing though, at this point it's not even the shirt, so much as what it represents. I reason with myself that if I give up this shirt, I'm giving up a small piece of myself. At the end of the day, either my shirt is going back in the closet, or I am. Eventually he pulls out the parental trump card and says "No, you're not keeping the shirt. That's final, discussion over." and gets up to leave. At this point, I made the decision that I'm not giving up my ideals, no matter what. If that involves backtalk, disrespect, treason, whatever, I'm keeping the shirt. So, I took the unprecedented step and said "No, sit back down, this needs to be a family discussion. I'm going to get mom.". This awakened a primal, seething rage within my father, but he managed to keep his calm. When I awoke my mom and dragged her back in here, I sat down back where I was, and faced both of my parents. 

"I'm bisexual."

Before I could comprehend it, the words had already left my lips. There was no going back. My dad knew, and that was it. The calm before the storm, there was nothing but silence. A bird can be heard chirping outside, happy and carefree, a stark contrast to to the scene playing out inside. For the longest 5 seconds, there was an empty blank as my dad tried to process what had just been said. And then, as if reading it from a script, he rose. Sitting in my chair, he towered over me. The growing silence shattered as a resounding scream of "FUCK YOU!" escaped him. The resulting scene will forever be engraved in my mind, no matter how much I try to forget it. 

"Are you shitting me?"
"You've got to be shitting me."
"My son's a faggot. God damn it!"
"Is that what you are? Some sort of tranny faggot homo?"
"Well?"
"Answer me, damn it!" he shouts, expecting me to answer. Hearing nothing, he continues.
"I can't believe this shit, my son's gay."
(I'm just going to omit the part about anal sex, you're welcome.)
