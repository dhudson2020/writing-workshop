A couple warnings: this memoir contains discussion about sexuality, strong language, and mentions of suicide. If this disturbs you, leave, and come back when you're above the age of 8. 

You've been warned.

I was around 12 or so, a relatively young age. There's no really specific event that I tie to me realizing things were off, just the realization that they were. It was at this point in my life that I realized that normal people don't have feelings for the same gender. Normal people only like the opposite sex and aggressively defend that fact. The most I'd do was joke off the thought of dating a guy, and usually I'd just keep quiet and sweat profusely. I, of course, did the natural thing anybody would do, given this situation, and shoved these feelings as far as I can into the deepest, darkest corners of my mind, where only my unholy love for spray can cheese resided. And after that? For a while, nothing. I kinda just forgot, and went about my 12 year old life like any normal kid would. 

Fast forward to me being 13 now, and I've kinda gotten more in tune with it. I've learned to accept it, and it's just kind of a part of me now. I'm not at odds with it, I'm not afraid of it, it's just kinda a part of me, just as much as the color of my hair, or my arm burn.
