i really just don't get
the whole being "straight" thing
like why lock yourself down
to only one gender?

imagine this:
you meet someone new.
the minute you meet
there's a connection.
chemistry between the two of you.
something more than a friendship.
is it...
love?
their eyes, their smile
they're amazing.
the way they laugh is incredible
and they have the best sense of humor.
everything about them is amazing.

but no, this can't be love.
why?
you're the same gender, and that's gay.
and so you stay friends, 
being hopelessly awkward to eachother
day
after
day.

now ponder this:
you meet someone new.
the opposite gender, this time.
you really feel a connection.
the way they do their hair,
the sweet smile they always wear.
they're amazing.
you finally, after months,
pick up the courage to talk to them.
and?

"oh, sorry. i'm gay."

sounds like a sucky situation, right?
imagine that flipped on it's head.
someone of the same gender.
who you're hopelessly in love with.
but they're straight.
