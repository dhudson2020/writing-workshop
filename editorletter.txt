To the editor:


Conversion therapy is a horrible, horrible practice and should be banned nationwide. Let me explain.
If you don't know what conversion therapy is, it's a special type of therapy you can give your child
to change their sexuality. Seems okay if a bit dodgy in concept, right? Well, the devil is in the 
details. Conversion therapy in practice is usually akin to torture. The child in question is 
electrocuted, beaten, whipped, and otherwise caused pain or suffering while being shown images or 
videos relating to their sexuality, in the hopes that their mind will associate being gay with being
shocked or tortured. There are laws to prevent this in 10 states (plus D.C.) but still 70% of the
LGBT population live in places where it's a legal practice. As of writing this, 13 states have
legislation in the process of being passed, and Missouri is one of them. Support House bill 2141
however you can, and we'll be one step closer to ending this torture forever.


Sincerely,
